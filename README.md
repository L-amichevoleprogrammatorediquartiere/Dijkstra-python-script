## I added the GUI for my Dijkstra algorithm
There are five methods in the creation of the graph:

- insert node: to insert a node in the graph (at the moment the circle of the graph are of a standard dimensione)

- delete node: not need explanation

- insert coll: to insert a line that connect 2 node

- delete coll: like "delete node" not need for explanation

and the last but not least

- select node->calculate: select the node for calculate the tab (at the moment print on the console and not in the window(sorry))
